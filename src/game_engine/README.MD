# The Blob-Royale Game State library

This library is designed to be usable with any http server.

All that is required is to intantiate the GameState class and start another thread to allow it to run the game simulation.



### Note

The source code includes the class `PhyVector` in order to represent vectors as they are understood in mathematics and physics (hence the name "Phy[sics] Vector".
The code also makes much use of sthe standard library `std::vector`. To avoid confusion, anywhere the word 'vector' appears in either variable or function names, it is to be understood as a `PhyVector`.
